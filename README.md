## This project is no longer serviced.
*Now this will work as my educational template only*.  
Gosh I worked this for months, really sad now.
But I've learned a lot from this project!

Here are the basic things that (should have) worked in my web service.   

1. Making personal profile

2. Search Celebs

3. Write a digital letter
